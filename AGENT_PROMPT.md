# Agent Prompt — TechRex Claude Code Setup

Copy the block below into Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / any coding agent.
The agent will clone this repo and install the full TechRex Claude setup
onto the current machine.

---

```
You are installing the TechRex Claude Code Setup Bundle onto this machine.

Repo: https://github.com/saiteja007-mv/techrex-claude-setup
Target: the current user's ~/.claude/ directory.
  - Linux/macOS: $HOME/.claude
  - Windows:     %USERPROFILE%\.claude  (use forward slashes in Git Bash)

Rules of engagement:
  - NEVER overwrite existing files I didn't tell you to overwrite.
  - NEVER clobber existing settings.json / config.json — merge only.
  - ALWAYS back up the existing ~/.claude before touching it.
  - NEVER commit, print, or transmit secrets you find in the existing config.
  - After each step, print ONE line: "✓ step N — <summary>".
  - At the end, print a table: ✓ / ⚠ / ✗ per section.

Run these steps in order:

1. DETECT ENVIRONMENT
   - Detect OS (Linux, macOS, Windows).
   - Resolve $HOME / %USERPROFILE%.
   - Confirm `claude` CLI is on PATH. If not, stop and tell me to install
     Claude Code first: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code

2. BACKUP
   - If ~/.claude exists: copy it to ~/.claude.bak-<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>/.
   - Report the backup path.

3. CLONE REPO
   - Clone https://github.com/saiteja007-mv/techrex-claude-setup into a
     temp dir (e.g. /tmp/techrex-claude-setup or %TEMP%\techrex-claude-setup).
   - If the dir already exists, `git pull` inside it instead.

4. MERGE CLAUDE.md (append, don't replace)
   - If ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md does not exist: copy the repo's .claude/CLAUDE.md verbatim.
   - If it DOES exist: append the repo's .claude/CLAUDE.md between markers
        # === BEGIN TechRex Bundle ===
        …
        # === END TechRex Bundle ===
     Skip the append if those markers already exist (idempotent).

5. COPY RULES (non-destructive)
   - For each file in repo .claude/rules/*.md:
       if not present in ~/.claude/rules/, copy it.

6. COPY SKILLS (non-destructive, 18 skills)
   - For each directory in repo .claude/skills/*:
       if not present in ~/.claude/skills/, copy the whole directory.
   - Do NOT overwrite existing skills with the same name.

7. COPY AGENTS (non-destructive, 10 agents)
   - For each .md in repo .claude/agents/ (including ccg/ subdir):
       if not present in ~/.claude/agents/, copy.

8. COPY COMMANDS (non-destructive, 57 commands)
   - For each .md under repo .claude/commands/ (ccg/, gsd/, vibe-*):
       if not present in ~/.claude/commands/<same-subpath>, copy.

9. STATUSLINE (optional — ask first)
   - Ask me: "Install TechRex statusline (ccstatusline)? [y/N]"
   - If yes: copy .claude/statusline.bat + .claude/statusline.js to ~/.claude/

10. SETTINGS.JSON (MERGE — critical)
    - Load the template at .claude/settings.json.template.
    - If ~/.claude/settings.json does NOT exist: copy the template, strip the
      "_NOTE" key, done.
    - If it DOES exist: deep-merge with these rules:
        • permissions.allow  → UNION (dedupe)
        • enabledPlugins     → UNION (don't flip user's existing flags)
        • extraKnownMarketplaces → UNION by key
        • hooks.PreToolUse   → APPEND new matchers (don't replace existing)
        • statusLine         → keep existing if set
        • skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt → keep existing if set
        • autoUpdatesChannel → keep existing if set
      Write the result back. Preserve formatting if possible.

11. CONFIG.JSON (MCP STUBS — MERGE — keep user's existing servers)
    - Load .claude/config.json.template.
    - If ~/.claude/config.json does NOT exist: copy the template.
    - If it DOES exist: merge mcpServers by key, NEVER overwriting existing
      server entries. Only ADD `search-console` and `n8n-mcp` if those keys
      are not already present.
    - Tell me: "MCP stubs added. Fill <YOUR_N8N_API_URL>, <YOUR_N8N_API_KEY>,
      and <YOUR_N8N_MCP_DIST_PATH> in ~/.claude/config.json before the n8n-mcp
      server will work."

12. INSTALL PLUGINS (10 plugins)
    - Open a Claude Code session and, for each of the 10 plugin slugs below,
      run `/plugin install <slug>`:
        document-skills@ando-marketplace
        frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
        n8n-mcp-skills@n8n-mcp-skills
        apify-ultimate-scraper@apify-agent-skills
        rust-analyzer-lsp@claude-plugins-official
        hugging-face-cli@huggingface-skills
        ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill
        marketing-skills@marketingskills
        codex@openai-codex
        claude-mem@thedotmack
    - If a plugin is already enabled, skip it. If it fails, note it in the
      final table but continue.

13. VERIFY
    - Count ~/.claude/skills/*       — expect >= 18
    - Count ~/.claude/agents/**/*.md — expect >= 10
    - Count ~/.claude/commands/**/*.md — expect >= 57
    - grep "Caveman Mode" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — expect a match
    - grep "RTK" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — expect a match
    - grep "graphify" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — expect a match
    - List enabled plugins (read enabledPlugins from settings.json).

14. FINAL REPORT
    - Print a single table with one row per section above:
        Section | Status | Notes
    - Print a reminder block:
        "Next steps:
          1) Fill MCP credentials in ~/.claude/config.json
          2) Review ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — remove sections you don't want
          3) Open a fresh terminal so Claude Code re-reads the config
          4) Run `/plugin` to confirm 10 plugins enabled"

Do not invent steps. Do not run destructive commands. Ask before installing
the statusline. If any step fails, stop and report — do not continue blindly.
```
